# --- Data Section ---
# This dataset tracks improvements in Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) from 2007 to 2022.
# PUE measures how efficiently a data center uses energy; lower values are better.
# Source: Supplementary Section 2.3 of the paper.

# Convert PUE to efficiency values for modeling purposes.
# Efficiency is defined as the inverse of PUE: eff = 1 / PUE
eff = 1 / pue

# --- Model Definition ---
# A generalized logistic function with flexible asymptotes is used to fit the trend.
# Parameters:
#   E_a0    - lower asymptote (baseline efficiency)
#   E_a1    - range between upper and lower asymptotes
#   alpha_a - growth rate
#   beta_a  - midpoint year (inflection point)
def logistic(years, E_a0, E_a1, alpha_a, beta_a):
    return E_a0 + E_a1 / (1 + np.exp(-alpha_a * (years - beta_a)))

# --- Curve Fitting ---
# Perform nonlinear regression to fit the logistic model to historical efficiency data.
# Initial guesses and bounds are based on expected ranges from past PUE observations.

par, covariance = curve_fit(logistic, years, eff, p0=initial_guess, bounds=bounds)

# --- Extract Parameters ---
# Unpack fitted values for later use in plotting and forecasting.
E_a0, E_a1, alpha_a, beta_a = par

# --- Historical Trendline ---
# Generate a smooth curve for the historical years to visualize model fit.
years_fit = np.linspace(min(years), max(years), 1000)

# Forecast efficiency gains 20 years beyond the latest recorded year (2022â€“2042).
future_years = np.linspace(max(years), max(years) + 20, 1000)
